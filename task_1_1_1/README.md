# Custom build script for HeapSort lab
Surely, it's smarter than Gradle.

### Execution
Open your favorite shell (no Ð¨indows!!) and type
> ./mybuild.sh [parameters]

Use ``-b`` to build, ``-r`` to build and run, ``-d`` to generate Javadoc, ``-h`` to get more information.
By default, all output can be found in mybuild/ folder

### SUSv2????????????????????
Script uses basic sh shell, so it should run on anything that at least a little POSIX compatible.

### Problems
Functionality to specify command line arguments is not yet implemented :(
